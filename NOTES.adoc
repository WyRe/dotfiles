= Important notes about some configs

== Neovim

NOTE: Though all `vim` config is placed in `~/.vimrc` file is it also necessary to fetch the `neovim` configuration because this config is linking that `~/.vimrc` file and `vim` is aliased in `~/.zshrc` to run `nvim`

IMPORTANT: All plugins require first to install `vim-plug`, this can be installed from AUR


python-mode plugin depends on `pylama`, `python-pylint` and `python-pynvim` which are in community and extra repos
